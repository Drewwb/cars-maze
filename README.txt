Welcome to our 2D Trivia Maze Game! This game was developed as a group project by three computer science students. Navigate your character through a challenging maze filled with doors. To unlock a door, answer trivia questions stored in an SQLite database. Find the key hidden randomly in the maze, and make your way to the exit door to win the game. The game supports saving and loading, so you can pick up right where you left off.
